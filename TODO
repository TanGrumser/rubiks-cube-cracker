Try furu'r'f'.  Seems like the initial bound estimate was 7, but it should be 6.
Now furu'r' edgeG2 shows 6, and furur shows 7.
furur solves in 9 moves? edgeG2Moves shows 6, not 5?
fururf doesn't solve by bound 14?  edgeG2Moves shows 0.
moving the back (B), edgeG2Moves shows 0.  Should be 1.  (Check, but I think I was wrong.)
fdf edgeG1 shows 5.
If I stash the current changes, there's a different result, but the
edgeG2Database at least seems to be returning the wrong number of moves.  There
are some backup IDA searchers in ~/temp/ (I was making memory optimizations).

Get rid of the getMoveFunc.  It's confusing and slow.  If all the cube models
shared an interface, then the move stores could be refactored and simplified
quite a bit.

Refactor RubiksCubeWorldObject and RubiksCubeModel to extend the new RubiksCube class.
Refactor RubiksCubeView to render any type of RubiksCube (no specialization needed).
Refactor MoveStores to move any type of RubikCube.

In the new IDA searcher, there could be a better solution after the goal is
satisfied.  Probably need to keep searching the current bound until complete.

In the IDA searcher a copy of the cube could be avoided (from successors to the
node stack) by using a buffer area or dynamic memory of some sort.

If KorfSolver is reverted, remember to inflate!

In IDA*, keep a set of seen cube states and check it when making the successor queue.
IDDFS could use this set, too.

Git rid of depth in IDDFS searcher.  Use moves.size().

IDDFS and IDA* should call index.

Try Thistlethwaite with the IDA* searcher and the Korf databases.  To do so,
though, the assumption that the heuristic will return 0 will have to be
removed.

There are some typos in the comments in the searchers (acieve and cust).

Try solving the scramble with 1 move F.  The solution is F F2, and that should
be simplified to F'.

There's a pattern database (GoalG3_Permate_Corners) that could be refactored to
use the new CornerPatternDatabase class.  As part of that get rid of the
corner_perms.txt file.

Try to solve the cube outright, then bail at depth 10.
